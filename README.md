# Aqua-Sense-Smart-Aquatic-Therapy-Suit
AquaSense Smart Aquatic Therapy Suit: The smart aquatic suit tracks heart rate, oxygen, and movement through sensors linked to a mobile app. Airbags and compression improve safety and muscle function during water exercises. With support from physiotherapy, MLT, radiology, and nutrition, the system provides a complete, safe approach to obesity management.
 The suit includes pulse, oxygen, and motion sensors connected to a mobile app. If vitals drop, airbags activate for safety. Water resistance aids exercise, compression reduces spasticity, and progress is supported by physiotherapy, MLT tests, radiology imaging, and nutritional guidance.
 This aquatic therapy suit makes exercise safer for obese patients by tracking vitals, offering muscle support, and preventing drowning with automatic airbags. It improves strength, flexibility, and metabolism, while physiotherapy, MLT, radiology, and nutrition provide full monitoring and guidance.
